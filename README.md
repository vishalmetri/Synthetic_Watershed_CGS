# Synthetic_Watershed_CGS

Repository to analyze synthetic images for Watershed Oversegmentation studies.

To generate all the figures in the article, run genFigs.m. The script is documented and all details of the intermediate steps are given. Generation of synthetic images and segmenting them with Watershed with any hmin is described in the steps.

To generate maps of hMinCrit, run genhCritMaps.m. Uncomment the necessary lines as described in the code and run as per requirement. All results in the paper can be reproduced with this code.
