% Function to obtain the spurious minima inside the overlap region
% with two corner pixels at diagonally opposite ends. The function plots
% the parabolic surfaces of Equation 1 from the paper and determines the
% line of intersection, Equation 3. It then tracks pixels along this line
% and for each pixel, checks 5 surrounding pixels towards either the bottom
% left corner or the top right corner, depending on whether it is closer to
% the other corner pixel, respectively. 
% Note that the internal co-ordinates used in the code are with respect to the
% bottom left corner pixel as origin.
% Input: cX1,cY1: X and Y coordinates of the bottom left corner pixel
%        cX2,cY2: X and Y coordinats of the top right corner pixel
% Output: The co-ordinates of spurious minima in the overlap region are
% printed out.
% Example: To obtain the results of section 3.1.2, call this function as
% follows: [x0 y0 minList] = findMinimaAbsolute(404,501,501,449).

function [x0 y0 minList] = findMinimaAbsolute(cX1,cY1,cX2,cY2)
%% Find width and height of overlap, call distance_surf to get x^2 + y^2 surface and plot line

% width
xc = abs(cX2 - cX1 + 1);
% height
yc = abs(cY1 - cY2 + 1);

% Plot parabolic surfaces
[surf1 surf2] = distance_surf(xc,yc);

% Line of intersection of surfaces in x-y plane
xLine = 0:0.1:xc;
yLine = -xLine*(xc/yc) + (0.5/yc)*(xc^2 + yc^2);
plot(xLine,yLine);

%% Book-keeping
minList = cell(xc,1);

%%% Find max and min limits of the border line
z = find(yLine > 0 & yLine <= yc);
s = max(size(z));
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%% Integer coordinates of border line %%%%%
if (xc < yc)
    y0 = max(round(yLine(z)),1);
else
    y0 = max(floor(yLine(z)),1);
end
%%%%
x0 = min(floor(xLine(z)) + 1,xc); % adding 1 to convert to coordinates
